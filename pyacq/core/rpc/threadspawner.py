class ThreadSpawner(object):
    """Utility for spawning and bootstrapping a new thread with an :class:`RPCServer`.
    
    Automatically creates an :class:`RPCClient` that is connected to the remote 
    thread (``spawner.client``).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str | None
        Optional process name that will be assigned to all remote log records.
    address : str
        ZMQ socket address that the new thread's RPCServer will bind to.
        Default is ``'tcp://127.0.0.1:*'``.
        
        **Note:** binding RPCServer to a public IP address is a potential
        security hazard (see :class:`RPCServer`).
    log_addr : str
        Optional log server address to which the new thread will send its log
        records.
    log_level : int
        Optional initial log level to assign to the root logger in the new
        thread.
