class Node(object):
    """
    A Node is the basic element for generating and processing data streams
    in pyacq. 
    
    Nodes may be used to interact with devices, generate data, store data, 
    perform computations, or display user interfaces. Each node may have multiple
    input and output streams that connect to other nodes. For example::
    
       [ data acquisition node ] -> [ processing node ] -> [ display node ]
                                                        -> [ recording node ]
    
    An application may directly create and connect the Nodes it needs, or it
    may use a Manager to create a network of nodes distributed across multiple
    processes or machines.
    
    The order of operations when creating and operating a node is very important:
    
    1. Instantiate the node directly or remotely using `NodeGroup.create_node`.
    2. Call `Node.configure(...)` to set global parameters such as sample rate,
       channel selections, etc.
    3. Connect inputs to their sources (if applicable):
       `Node.inputs['input_name'].connect(other_node.outpouts['output_name'])`
    4. Configure outputs: `Node.outputs['output_name'].configure(...)`
    5. Call `Node.initialize()`, which will verify input/output settings, 
       allocate memory, prepare devices, etc.
    6. Call `Node.start()` and `Node.stop()` to begin/end reading from input 
       streams and writing to output streams. These may be called multiple times.
    7. Close the node with `Node.close()`. If the node was created remotely, 
       this is handled by the NodeGroup to which it belongs.
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    For convenience, if a Node has only 1 input or 1 output:
    
    * `Node.inputs['input_name']` can be written `Node.input`
    * `Node.outputs['output_name']` can be written `Node.output`
    
    When there are several outputs or inputs, this shorthand is not permitted.
    
    The state of a Node can be requested using thread-safe methods:
    
    * `Node.running()`
    * `Node.configured()`
    * `Node.initialized()`
